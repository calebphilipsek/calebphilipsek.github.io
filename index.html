        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>   My name is Caleb Philipsek, I was born and raised in Minnesota. 
            More specifically I was raised in a quaint suburb of the Twin Cities called Apple valley.
            I lived within walking distance of a bowling alley that I loved to frequent in the summers.
            I've traveled throughout many places in the US, either with my family or through the Boy Scouts of America. 
            Some of my favorite trips consist of a trip to Seattle with my soon-to-be wife, family trips to Boston and Maryland and a scout trip to 
            </br>
            I followed my sisters to Montana State University where I attained a BS in Computer Science in May 2024. 
            I graduated with a 3.0 GPA but I really hit my stride in my last 2 semesters of school when I fell in love with the more unstructured and application-based classes, such as my Human Computer Interaction, Compilers Capstone and Computational Biology classes.
            I was able to finally link the theory I was learning to how that theory is applied and why it should be applied
